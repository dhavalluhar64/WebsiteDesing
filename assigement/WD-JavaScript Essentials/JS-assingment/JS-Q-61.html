    <!-- Q.(61) Array vs object defences in JS? -->

    <!-- 
    (1) Array

    ->   An Array is a collection of data and a data structure that is stored in a sequence of memory locations. One can
      access the elements of an array by calling the index number such as 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦, etc. The array can store data
      types like Integer, Float, String, and Boolean all the primitive data types can be stored in an array. -->


    <script>

        const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
        console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: 'banana'



    </script>



    <!-- (2) Object

    -> It stores multiple values in a single variable. The object can contain anything in the real world such as person
       names, cars, and game characters. Objects are very easy to use in some situations if you know where the data is
       being processed. The character set of objects is known as Properties. The properties of an object can be called by
       using DOT notation and [] notation. -->


    <script>
        const person = {
            name: 'John',
            age: 30,
            hobbies: ['reading', 'gaming'],
        };
        console.log(person.name); // Output: 'John'

    </script>
