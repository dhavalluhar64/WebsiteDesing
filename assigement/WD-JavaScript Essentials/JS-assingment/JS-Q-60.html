    <!-- Q.(60) What is Bom vs Dom in JS? -->

    <!-- 1.DOM (Document Object Model)

    -> The DOM represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. Each element in the document is
    an object that can be manipulated using JavaScript.

    Usage: You can use the DOM to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of a web page. Common methods
           include

    * document.getElementById()

    * document.querySelector()

    * element.innerHTML

    * element.style -->




    <!-- 2.BOM (Browser Object Model)

    -> The BOM provides a way to interact with the browser itself and includes objects that represent the browser
    window, frames, history, location, and other browser-related functionalities.

    Usage: You can use the BOM to manipulate browser-related properties and methods. Some common components include


   * window (the global object for the browser)

   * navigator (information about the browser)

   * location (URL of the current document)

   * history (history of the userâ€™s navigation) -->
